# Hacky Formidable Wordpress plugin for sending form entries to Hubspot Forms

Forked from formidable-api, https://formidablepro.com/knowledgebase/formidable-api/.

Formidable is good at form design and collecting form entries on Wordpress sites, but not very good at CRM. Hubspot CRM is good at CRM, but the Forms aren't as easy to use inside Wordpress as Formidable. This lets Formidable forms POST a webhook to the Hubspot Form Submission endpoint to create customers in hubspot, with configurable webhook data just like formidable-api.
